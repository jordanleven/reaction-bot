# Reaction Bot

A simple bot that can listen for reactions with specific emoji in Slack.

## Configuring Reaction Bot

In `internal/reactions.go`, you may register an unlimited number of emoji reactions in `registeredReactions`. When the emoji identified as the key is used in any channel where Reaction Bot is added, the message will be posted to the identified channel.

```go
  // The name of the bot reaction. This is only used when logging reactions on the server.
  Name         string
  // The username of the bot when posting the reaction to te channel.
  BotName      string
  // The emoji of the bot when posting the reaction to the channel.
  BotIconEmoji string
  // The channel to post the reaction to.
  Channel      string
```

When registered in `registeredReactions`, a bot named "Mr. Randomness" with that will post messages to the "random" channel when reacted to with the "laughing" emoji would look like this.

```go
"laughing": {
  Name:         "Randomness",
  BotName:      "Mr. Randomness",
  BotIconEmoji: ":joy:",
  Channel:      "random",
},
```
